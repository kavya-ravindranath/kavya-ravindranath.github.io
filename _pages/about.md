Hi! I’m a fifth year Economics PhD candidate at the **George Washington University**. My primary research interests lie in the intersection of **Public Finance, Urban, Political Economy, and Development**. 

Prior to starting the PhD I was a Research Associate at [CAFRAL](https://www.cafral.org.in/Research.aspx).
I spent the summer of 2025 as a consultant at the [IFC](https://www.ifc.org/en/home) and the summer of 2022 as a Research Associate at the [University of Chicago's Urban Labs](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment).
