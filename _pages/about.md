Hi! I’m a fifth year Economics PhD candidate at **George Washington University**. My primary research interests lie in **Public Finance, Urban, Political Economy, and Development**. 

Prior to starting the PhD I was a Research Associate at [CAFRAL](https://www.cafral.org.in/Research.aspx)
During the PhD, I spent one summer as a consultant at the [IFC](https://www.ifc.org/en/home) and one as a Research Associate at the Univerity of Chicago's Urban Labs(https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/energy-environment)
